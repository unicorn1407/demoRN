# RN Demo - React Native Expo Managed Flow

Welcome to RN Demo! This is a React Native application built using Expo's managed workflow. This README will guide you through the steps to get the project up and running on your local development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (Recommended version: 14 LTS or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js installation)
- Git
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/unicorn1407/demoRN.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   
   Change your current directory to the project's folder:
    ```bash
   cd RNDemo
3. **Install Dependencies:**
    
    Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:
    ```bash
     npm install or yarn
4. **Start the Development Server**:
    
    Launch the Expo development server:

    ```bash
    expo start
    ```
    This will open a browser window displaying a QR code.

5. **Run the App**:

   You can run the app on a physical device or an emulator. Follow one of the methods below:

   **Physical Device**: Install the **Expo Go** app from the App Store or Google Play Store.
Scan the QR code displayed in your browser using the Expo Go app.
   **Emulator**:
    For iOS: Click on "Run on iOS simulator" in the browser window.
    For Android: Click on "Run on Android device/emulator" in the browser window.

6.  **Explore the App**:
    Once the app is running, you should see it on your chosen device or emulator. You can now explore the app, make changes to the code, and see the changes in real-time.
